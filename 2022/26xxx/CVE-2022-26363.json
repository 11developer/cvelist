This scheme is used to maintain invariants required\nfor Xen's safety, e.g. PV guests may not have direct writeable access to\npagetables; updates need auditing by Xen.\n\nUnfortunately, Xen's safety logic doesn't account for CPU-induced cache\nnon-coherency; cases where the CPU can cause the content of the cache to\nbe different to the content in main memory.  In such cases, Xen's safety\nlogic can incorrectly conclude that the contents of a page is safe."
