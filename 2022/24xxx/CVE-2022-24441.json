An attacker who can convince a user to scan a malicious project can include \r\ncommands in a build file such as build.gradle or gradle-wrapper.jar, which will be executed with the privileges of the application.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability may be triggered when running the the CLI tool directly, or when running a scan with one of the IDE plugins that invoke the Snyk CLI.\r\n\r\nSuccessful exploitation of this issue would likely require some level of social engineering - to coerce an untrusted project to be downloaded and analyzed via the Snyk CLI or opened in an IDE where a Snyk IDE plugin is installed and enabled. Additionally, if the IDE has a Trust feature then the target folder must be marked as \u2018trusted\u2019 in order to be vulnerable.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This issue is independent of the one reported in [CVE-2022-40764](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3037342), and upgrading to a fixed version for this addresses that issue as well.\r\n\r\nThe affected IDE plugins and versions are:\r\n\r\n- VS Code - Affected: <=1.8.0, Fixed: 1.9.0\r\n- IntelliJ - Affected: <=2.4.47, Fixed: 2.4.48\r\n- Visual Studio - Affected: <=1.1.30, Fixed: 1.1.31\r\n- Eclipse - Affected: <=v20221115.132308, Fixed: All subsequent versions\r\n- Language Server - Affected: <=v20221109.114426, Fixed: All subsequent versions\n"
